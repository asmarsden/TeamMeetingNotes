# Team Meeting Notes

This website will hold the notes from each meeting.


# Sprint 1 Plan Meeting Notes:

Meeting started September 10th, 2020 at 11:55 AM.

We have decided that unless we are on campus for class, we will meet remotely over Discord. This will allow us to more easily share our screens and talk about code, and also avoid unnecessary trips to and from campus.

* Our meeting times will be Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays during the afternoon, after we have all completed our classes and tasks for the day. 

We will be using a Github workflow in which we make our changes on branches specific to the task we are making changes for, and once that task is complete, merge that branch into master. This way we can link that branch or pull request to our task management software for each task, making it easier to keep track of our workflow. This is also the workflow used in Aislinn's coop experience, and the general consensus is that using the same workflow in this project will be good practice for the future. Also, this way nothing gets committed directly to the master branch and breaks everything on accident.

Griffin did a large chunk of research into potential frameworks, and found that using Angular and Spring would be useful. Angular will make the website frontend much easier to manage, Spring will help with handling database requests, and the combination of the two is well documented in resources online, which allows for an easier time learning how to use them.

* We have decided that for the time being, Griffin and Aislinn will focus on the website and hosting situation while Sam and Evan focus on the android application. 

* We decided that before our first standup, we would each do research into aspects of this project such as frameworks, IDEs, hosting possibilities, and so on. 

* Note: hosting through UA will mean intranet hosting, not internet hosting. This means that if we host anything through UA, we will need to have a VPN or be on campus for testing purposes.

We populated our task management dashboard with some tasks: creating a blank website, creating a blank application, hosting the website somewhere, figuring out button mechanics on the android app, and learning how to set up a redirect if the link is opened on a device with the application installed. These are subject to change, and probably will not take up the entire sprint, so more tasks will be added as necessary.



# Standup Meeting Notes

## September 14th, 2020

### General Notes

* We have collectively decided that Spring/Angular framework is our best option. The learning curve is high, but once we work past that, it should be very useful in our situation.

* We will add another task to our task list in which a basic, empty database is created for testing purposes, since the tasks we decided on during our sprint planning will not take the entire sprint, and the database is the most crucial part of this system.

* We plan to do code reviews as they are needed, partially for sanity checks and partially to share the knowledge of various pieces of the system amongst all four members of the team.

* Github IO should be able to host our website(s) for the time being. 


### Griffin:
* **Has done:** Created the discord, posted some resources for spring, angular, and security related learning.  
* **Will do:** Explore options related to database and database communication.  
* **Challenges:** Nothing quite yet.  


### Sam:
* **Has done:** Research into the frameworks we plan to use.  
* **Will do:** Download and set up Android Studio, try to get a blank application created.  
* **Challenges:** Nothing quite yet, except general lack of knowledge about new frameworks and IDEs.  


### Evan:
* **Has done:** Research into android development and frameworks.  
* **Will do:** More research into android development, download and set up Android Studio.  
* **Challenges:** Nothing quite yet, but little experience with android development.  


### Aislinn:
* **Has done:** Research into web development and frameworks.  
* **Will do:** More research, set up the blank websites necessary for the project.  
* **Challenges:** Nothing quite yet, but little knowledge of web development and frameworks.  


## September 16th, 2020

### General Notes:

* In debating between types of databases, we decided we would prefer to use NoSQL. 


### Griffin:
* **Has done:** Researched using Maven to help with project development. Identified possible NoSQL database options.   
* **Will do:** Compile information on environment, framework, and any other necessary project information in a digestible format for other group members to have to reference.   * **Challenges:** hard to get a clear full picture of everything at this point - Working with android side to plan out what would work best with them to begin making decisions.   


### Sam:
* **Has done:** Downloaded android studio and researched android application frameworks.  
* **Will do:** Will connect android studio to our repository and upload a blank android studio project file. Will also research more into frameworks.  
* **Challenges:** Integrating any solutions/frameworks with android studio - very little experience with android studio.  


### Evan:
* **Has done:** Continued research in android frameworks.  
* **Will do:** Refresh on Java language and research how other users implemented Java into their apps.  
* **Challenges:** Still no experience in android frameworks and little knowledge of java.  


### Aislinn:
* **Has done:** Set up project website, meeting notes website, and temporary web app website through Github IO, and populated the meeting notes website with all the meetings to date.  
* **Will do:** Research into database hosting options, since some companies do free hosting of small databases. Research into website hosting for web app, potentially using the same service but unsure of that yet. Install and set up android studio in case needed later.   
* **Challenges:** No experience with database hosting or website hosting, research needed.
