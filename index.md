## Team Meeting Notes

This website will hold the notes from each meeting.


### Sprint 1 Plan Meeting Notes:

Meeting started September 10th, 2020 at 11:55 AM.

We have decided that unless we are on campus for class, we will meet remotely over Discord. This will allow us to more easily share our screens and talk about code, and also avoid unnecessary trips to and from campus.

Our meeting times will be Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays during the afternoon, after we have all completed our classes and tasks for the day. 

Note: hosting through UA will mean intranet hosting, not internet hosting. This means that if we host anything through UA, we will need to have a VPN or be on campus for testing purposes.

We have decided that for the time being, Griffin and Aislinn will focus on the website and hosting situation while Sam and Evan focus on the android application. 

We will be using a Github workflow in which we make our changes on branches specific to the task we are making changes for, and once that task is complete, merge that branch into master. This way we can link that branch or pull request to our task management software for each task, making it easier to keep track of our workflow. This is also the workflow used in Aislinn's coop experience, and the general consensus is that using the same workflow in this project will be good practice for the future. Also, this way nothing gets committed directly to the master branch and breaks everything on accident.

Griffin did a large chunk of research into potential frameworks, and found that using Angular and Spring would be useful. Angular will make the website frontend much easier to manage, Spring will help with handling database requests, and the combination of the two is well documented in resources online, which allows for an easier time learning how to use them.

We decided that before our first standup, we would each do research into aspects of this project such as frameworks, IDEs, hosting possibilities, and so on. 

We also populated our task management dashboard with some tasks: creating a blank website, creating a blank application, hosting the website somewhere, figuring out button mechanics on the android app, and learning how to set up a redirect if the link is opened on a device with the application installed. These are subject to change, and probably will not take up the entire sprint, so more tasks will be added as necessary.



### Standup Meeting Notes

#### September 14th, 2020

We have collectively decided that Spring/Angular framework is our best option. The learning curve is high, but once we work past that, it should be very useful in our situation.

We will add another task to our task list in which a basic, empty database is created for testing purposes, since the tasks we decided on during our sprint planning will not take the entire sprint, and the database is the most crucial part of this system.

We plan to do code reviews as they are needed, partially for sanity checks and partially to share the knowledge of various pieces of the system amongst all four members of the team.

Github IO should be able to host our website(s) for the time being. 

##### Griffin:
Has done: Created the discord, posted some resources for spring, angular, and security related learning. 
Problems: Nothing quite yet.
Will do: Explore options related to database and database communication.

##### Sam:
Has done: Research into the frameworks we plan to use.
Problems: Nothing quite yet, except general lack of knowledge about new frameworks and IDEs.
Will do: Download and set up Android Studio, try to get a blank application created

##### Evan:
Has done: Research into android development and frameworks.
Problems: Nothing quite yet, but little experience with android development.
Will do: More research into android development, download and set up Android Studio.

##### Aislinn:
Has done: Research into web development and frameworks.
Problems: Nothing quite yet, but little knowledge of web development and frameworks.
Will do: More research, set up the blank websites necessary for the project.
